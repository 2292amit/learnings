Motherboard

Its a board which has slots for multiple components required for functioning of CPU
Following components

- CPU
- RAM
- ROM
- Peripherals - keyboard/mouse etc
- Storage (SATA connector being changed to NVME now which is faster)

Storage

HDD - Hard disk drive: 200Mbps write speed
Magnetic nails
Assume multiple nails in a series which can be magnetised and non magnetised with power and property is retained without power tooo
disk
read-write ARM
FAT - File allocation table -used in windows

SSD - solid state drive - 700 to 4000 Mbps write speed
Much faster and smaller. Less power consumption. Though still use HDD as its cheaper
Uses NVME connector which is much faster than SATA

RAM - Random access memory - volatile
ROM - Read only memory - non volatile
EEPROM - Electronically erasable programmable ROM


SSD types:
SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) : older interface. most affordable
mSATA or Mini-SATA SSDs: similar to sata but smaller port and a bit expensive. Can be used in smaller devices. 
NGFF M.2 SSDs: Different type of slot. Similar performance. Can accomodate other things like usb. Can use SSD using M2 and HDD using SATA in same mother board.
NVMe PCIe SSDs: Connects using M2. Fastest upto 3000 Mbps write speed


RAM
DRAM: Dynamic RAM, each bit has 1 capacitor and transistor to store data. Capacitor leaks data so has to be refreshed in few ms. Bit slow but less expensive. Commonly used

SRAM: Static RAM: 4 to 6 tansistor for 1 bit. More expensive but faster.

DRAM is typically used in computer
SDRAM - Synchronous DRAM
DDR SDRAM: Dual data rate SDRAM - DDR1---DDR4 (most recent) 3200 MT/s -Double the speed of SDR SDRAM
